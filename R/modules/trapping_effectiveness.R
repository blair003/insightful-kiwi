# trapping_effectiveness.R — "Trapping effectiveness": does checking more often catch more PER
# trap-night? Catch rate (per 100 trap-nights) by check cadence, faceted by austral season so the
# seasonal peak isn't mistaken for a checking effect. Species-filterable; a basis toggle switches the
# denominator between nominal trap-nights (counts dead/sprung time as effort) and operational
# (availability-corrected). Sibling to Bait effectiveness. Data from ik_trap_effectiveness().

#' Body of the "how to read this" help modal — a tabbed (paginated) walkthrough. `norm` is the
#' catch-rate normalisation unit (trap-nights) from project config, woven into the prose so the
#' modal never disagrees with the chart's axis. @keywords internal
